                <h3>Two brothers, born and raised in Pittsburgh, coming together under one groove, for their love of music</h3></br>
                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <h3><p>Were just two guys that have a passion to make music, it just so happens we are brothers, call us lucky I guess. I (Tony) had Joe curious about my music at a young age, when he enlisted in the army I thought he wouldn't have time for it. Once he was out of basic training though, he didn't waste anytime asking me when I was gona ship the decks up to him. Joe was buying more vinyl than I was at one point in time, and when he finally came home for good, I was happy to see we were on the same level musically. Between the two of us we had almost 3 completely full flight cases of records, and wasted no time breaking them in.</p><p>Tony Schirripa aka Dagosandiego knew he had a passion for music at a very young age. Even as a child there were always headphones in his ears or music playing in the background. At 13 he began to learn electric guitar and took lessons a few times a week. Throughout high school his love for music grew even stronger as he took as many music courses his school would allow. When he was just 17 years old there was talk of a "rave" taking place at IUP university at an indoor ice rink/soccer arena. Being so passionate about music, he knew that attending wasn't an option. Having attended groove at club laga in oakland several times, he thought he knew what to expect. To his surprise it was nothing like the club nights he had attended, there were thousands of people in attendance and more lights and sound than he had ever seen. That was also the first time he had ever seen DJ Dan in person. From that point on he was determined to share his love for this music with anyone who was willing to listen. In the following months he went to several local record stores and carefully chose the funkiest records he could find with the little money he had. Practice was the name of the game from here on out, and with the help of his friends at NRG productions, it wasn't long before he was sharing his music with the masses. Fast forward to the year 2013, not only does DSD have 12+ years of DJing under his belt, he is more driven that ever to deliver a sound that keeps people dancing til the sun comes up. Teaming up with his brother, Shey Monks, these two are on a mission to share their music with the world and beyond. Recently supporting acts such as Manufactured Superstars, Seven Lions, Felix Cartal, Brad Smith, and many other regional talents. This dynamic duo is on track to be in the spotlight for years to come.</p></h3></br>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3><p>Pittsburgh born and bred, brothers <strong>Tony</strong> (<em>Dagosandiego</em>) and <strong>Joe</strong> (<em>Shey Monks</em>) Schirripa decided long ago that together they were a force to be reckoned with in the dance music scene. With over 20+ years of combined experience DJing, they realized that by producing their own tracks the sound they created would be all their own. With Joe specializing in analog synthesis and Tony with his distinct percussion and drum arrangements, these two are the perfect team to deliver banging house tracks to the dancefloor, and keep people dancing til the sun comes up. What do you get when you combine two brothers, one whose drive to perfect his productions grows daily, and the other has over 10 years of DJing under his belt and mixing skills that will have you wondering where one track begins and the other ends??? The answer.....The Kosmonauts, thats what you get!!</p></h3></br>
